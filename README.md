### Swift Package Manager
[Swift Package Manager][1] is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies on all platforms.

Adding `Parma` as a dependency by [using Xcode’s GUI][2], the package url is `https://github.com/dasautoooo/Parma` .

Bodoni was an Italian typographer, type-designer in Parma. During his lifespan, he designed many typefaces that known as [Bodoni][5] nowadays. Each Mac has Bodoni font installed, and free to use.
