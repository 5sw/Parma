### Swift Package Manager
[Swift Package Manager][1] is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies on all platforms.
Adding `Parma` as a dependency by [using Xcode’s GUI][2], the package url is `https://github.com/dasautoooo/Parma` .

## Name Origin
[Parma][3] is a city in the northern Italian famous for its architecture, music and art. The reason of choosing this city name as the project name is that there was a famous typographer spent most his lifetime living and working in this city - [Giambattista Bodoni][4].
Bodoni was an Italian typographer, type-designer in Parma. During his lifespan, he designed many typefaces that known as [Bodoni][5] nowadays. Each Mac has Bodoni font installed.
